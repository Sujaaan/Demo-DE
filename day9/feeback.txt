1. Grain Definition		                You’ve clearly stated grain in the refined model phase — e.g., “1 row per sales transaction line.” That’s good. You could strengthen it further by showing multiple examples, especially where grain was ambiguous and how it was clarified.
2. SCD Classification		            Your SCD application is accurate. Good use of Type-2 for customer, Type-1 for product, Type-0 for geography. You’ve also added columns like is_current, effective dates, etc. A diagram or snippet showing the schema pre/post SCD application would be excellent.
3. Surrogate Keys		                You mention missing surrogate keys and their addition. You could improve by briefly explaining why natural keys alone are dangerous (e.g., updates causing data loss, duplicates). A quick example would boost clarity.
4. Naming Conventions		            Great job stating adherence to naming conventions like dim_, fct_, snake_case, etc. Bonus: mention any tool or template used to enforce this.
5. Relationship Clarity	                Somewhat vague	You said “unclear relationships,” but didn’t dive into what that looked like. Adding a before vs after diagram showing table joins and cardinality (1:N, M:N) would be helpful.
6. Confidence Building Measures		    Your steps like peer sign-off, hands-on labs, and retrospectives are strong. It would be great to include how these labs were executed — e.g., with PySpark, SQL scripts, dbt — to show practical application.
7. Outcome Clarity		                You outlined the outcome well (learner confidence, better models, alignment). Try to quantify this if possible — “Model rework time reduced by X%,” or “90% of learners reported improved clarity in SCD choices.” Even if hypothetical, that adds depth.
8. Key Learnings & Recommendations		Clear, structured, and well-reasoned. You could also note tools or frameworks (e.g., dbt, ER/Studio, Lucidchart) to make the takeaways more actionable.
